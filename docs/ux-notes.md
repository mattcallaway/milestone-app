# UX Notes

## Design Principles

1. **Safe by Default** - Users should feel confident they can explore without causing damage
2. **Clear Mode Indication** - Always show whether the app is in read-only or write mode
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential controls first, advanced options on demand

## UI States

### Read-Only Mode (Default)
- Visual indicator showing "Read-Only" status
- Write operations are disabled with clear messaging
- Encourages exploration and testing

### Write Mode
- Warning indicator when write mode is active
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Clear undo/rollback options where possible

## Future Considerations

- Dark mode support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
